<div id="title">What are people attracted to? (Page currently not working in Chrome)</div><br>

<p>Recently, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, author of Everybody Lies, told
    <a href="https://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/6/27/15873072/google-porn-addiction-america-everybody-lies">Vox in
    an interview</a> that, according to data from porn searches online, people generally hide what they're truly
    attracted to and instead date people that they think other people are attracted to as a means of improving
    their social standing.</p>
<p>I wanted to see if I could support this hypothesis using data from a speed dating experiment carried out by
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment">Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar from Columbia
    Business School and posted on kaggle.com</a>. Before the experiment, participants answered their own preferences
    for 6 attributes when evaluating compatibility with a person of the opposite sex (all relationships examined in
    this experiment were heterosexual), as well as how they think other members of their sex evaluate and how they
    think members of the other sex evaluate potential partner. Then, during the speed dating experiment, each person
    rated their partner on each of the 6 attributes and indicated their level of attraction.
</p>
<div id="visualization" align="center">
    <div id="chart1" class="col-md-6"><h1>What Women Want</h1></div>
    <div id="chart2" class="col-md-6"><h1>What Men Want</h1></div>
</div>
<p>From my analysis of the experiment, it appears that a person's selections in potential dating partners is far
    different from their stated preferences. Regardless of gender, on average, a person's perception of the preferences
    of other members of their gender is more accurate indicator of their true dating preferences.</p>
<p>Several other surprising insights appear in the results. Shared interests played a much larger part in attraction
    than the participants predicted. Intelligence and sincerity were both much less impactful than participants
    expected.</p>
<p>To produce this diagram, I learned from previous work by <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/6506614">Nadieh
    Bremer</a>.
