<div id="title">What are people attracted to?</div><br>

<p>Recently, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, author of Everybody Lies, told
    <a href="https://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/6/27/15873072/google-porn-addiction-america-everybody-lies">Vox in
    an interview</a> that, according to data from porn searches online, he believes people are more likely to choose
    dating partners based on attributes that they believe will impress their peers instead of their true personal
    preferences.</p>
<p>I wanted to see if I could support this hypothesis using data from a speed dating experiment carried out by
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment">Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar from Columbia
    Business School and posted on kaggle.com</a>. Before the experiment, participants answered their own preferences
    for 6 attributes when evaluating compatibility with a person of the opposite sex (all relationships examined in
    this experiment were heterosexual), as well as how they think other members of their sex evaluate and how they
    think members of the other sex evaluate potential partner. Then, during the speed dating experiment, each person
    rated their partner on each of the 6 attributes and indicated their level of attraction.
</p>
<div id="visualization" align="center">
    <div id="chart1" class="col-md-6"><h1>What Women Want</h1></div>
    <div id="chart2" class="col-md-6"><h1>What Men Want</h1></div>
</div>
<p>From my analysis of the experiment, it appears that a person's selections in potential dating partners is quite
    different from their stated preferences. Furthermore, regardless of gender, people's true preferences are closer
    to what they believe other people are attracted to than what they claim to desire themselves. In the diagrams,
    the orange line (perceived preference of society) is almost always closer to the green line (true preference) than
    the blue line (state preference). In the few times where that is untrue, the lines are extremely close.
</p>
<p>Of course, the data has several possible interpretations as well. People may be intentionally misreporting their
    preferences in order to make themselves appear more favorable. This bias is called social desirability bias.
</p>
<p>The dramatic underestimation of the importance of shared interests is also interesting. Based on other data included
    in the experiment, it appears that people are not good at recognizing their true degree of shared interests (as
    calculated based on their responses on an presurvey). Thus, people appear to believe (wrongly in many cases) that
    they have shared interests if they find the other individual attractive based on other factors. This does not
    invalidate this finding, however, as the importance of the self-reported perceived level of shared interests is
    relevant to the question.
